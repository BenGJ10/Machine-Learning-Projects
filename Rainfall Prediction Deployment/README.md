# Rainfall Prediction Model Deployment

## Project Overview  
This project aims to **predict rainfall** using various **atmospheric parameters** such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed. The machine learning model is built using **Random Forest Classifier**, trained on the `rainfall.csv` dataset from Kaggle. The model is deployed using **Flask** and will be soon hosted on **AWS EC2**.

## Features  
**Rainfall Prediction:** Predicts the likelihood of rainfall based on input weather conditions.  
**User-Friendly Web Interface:** Interactive form to input weather parameters.  
**Flask-Based Backend:** Lightweight and efficient API for model inference.  
**Modern UI:** Clean and professional front-end using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
**Deployment Ready:** Designed for deployment on **AWS EC2**. Will deploy soon.
