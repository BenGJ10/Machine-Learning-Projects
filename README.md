### 6. [Telco Customer Churn Prediction](./Telco%20Customer%20Churn%20Prediction)
Churn prediction helps telecom providers retain customers by identifying those likely to discontinue services. This project analyzes customer demographics, usage patterns, contract types, and service history. It applies classification models to derive actionable insights for churn mitigation and is an example of applying ML in customer lifecycle management.

---

### 7. [Traffic Accident Prediction](./Traffic%20Accident%20Prediction)
This project models the likelihood of traffic accidents occurring under varying conditions, such as weather, road type, time of day, and traffic density. It aims to aid city planners, law enforcement, and transportation departments in reducing road accidents through predictive safety measures and data-informed policies.

---

### 8. [Titanic Survival Prediction](./Titanic%20Survival%20Prediction)
This project explores survival prediction on the Titanic based on passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, family size, and embarkation point. It includes extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and classification modeling. The project demonstrates the use of historical data for binary prediction problems and provides a foundation for understanding supervised learning workflows.
